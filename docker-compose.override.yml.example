# docker-compose.override.yml
# 
# This file allows you to override settings in docker-compose.yml
# without modifying the original file.
#
# Usage:
# 1. Copy this file: cp docker-compose.override.yml.example docker-compose.override.yml
# 2. Uncomment and modify the settings you want to change
# 3. Run: docker-compose up -d
#
# Docker Compose automatically merges docker-compose.yml with docker-compose.override.yml
